0.  The public key polynomial 'a' should not be stored in NTT form in
    either the public key or the signature, since that forces a
    dependency on a particular choice of NTT.

    It can be stored in ntt form in the private key. I guess when we
    write the private key out to a file we would store "a" not in ntt
    form.
